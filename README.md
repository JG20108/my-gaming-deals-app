# My Gaming Deals App ðŸŽ®

Welcome to My Gaming Deals App, a project designed to help gamers find the best deals on PC games across multiple stores, including Steam, GreenManGaming, Fanatical, and many others. This app is built using the power of the [CheapShark API](https://www.cheapshark.com), a comprehensive price comparison service for digital PC games.

## Features

- **ðŸ’² Deals**: Fetch and display game deals from Steam. Each deal includes price, savings, and other metadata for games available on Steam. Deals are fetched from the following endpoint:
  ```

  ```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (v18.2.0), TypeScript (v5.2.2), Vite (v5.2.0)
- **Styling**: CSS
- **API**: CheapShark API for fetching game deals

## Dependencies

To ensure the app runs smoothly, the following dependencies are included in the project:

- `axios` for making HTTP requests
- `react` and `react-dom` for building the user interface
- `react-range` for creating range sliders for filters
- Development dependencies like `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, and `eslint` for code quality and development experience

Refer to `package.json` for the complete list of dependencies and their versions.

## Project Status
